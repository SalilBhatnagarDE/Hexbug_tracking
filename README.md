# About the Project
Computer vision is one of the major tasks and applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Gaining hands-on experience is therefore of great importance for future AI developers. 

In the Tracking Olympiad Project : Summer Semester 2023 at FAU Erlangen, Germany, students use the latest object detection and tracking algorithms to track a freely, randomly moving object ("HexBug") in a given arena. 

A set of videos are provided that contain the ground-truth positional information and we will implement an own tracking technique.
